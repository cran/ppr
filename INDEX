Projection Pursuit Regression
=============================

A more flexible formula-based replacement for ppreg.

	ppr
	print.ppr
	summary.ppr
	predict.ppr
	plot.ppr

The underlying code, like that of ppreg, is J.H. Friedman's SMART 
program. Unlike ppreg, smoothing can be done by smoothing splines.


Also, kernel smoothing, Friedman's `super smoother' and smoothing splines:

	ksmooth
	supsmu
	smooth.spline
	predict.smooth.spline
	print.smooth.spline


The code for smoothing splines comes from gamfit by T. Hastie and 
R. Tibshirani, and supsmu from SMART.
